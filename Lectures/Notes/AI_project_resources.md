- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Structured data, Language Data, Recommendation system data

Inifnitely flexible function - All-purpose parameter-fitting - Fast and scalable 
- Universal aproximation theroem - this type of function can solve any abritrality problem, given set parameters
- Gradient Decent
- Learning Rate (Cyclica learning rates for trainnig nueral networks)


#Learn
- ERD (etntity relation diagrams
    - tablenames
    - class/function names
- Study up to lesson 4
- NumPy, fastai, and spacy library
- LSTM, NLP, RNN, CNN

#Jupyter Notebook
- Tab for a drop down of functions starting with the letter you pic
- Shift tab to get agument parameters, twice for documentation, thrice
  pops up the same information in a seperate window
- Put a question mark at the start of a function and return it to get documentaion in a seperate window, two question marks for source code
- Press H for the keyboard shortcuts

- work on somethung the writes to a database and pulls info 
- upload pictures (png,jped) 
- have firwall running 
- flask
  
#Definition 
Overfitting- when you overtrain and your model sarts focusing too much on the details and starts missing the general idea
