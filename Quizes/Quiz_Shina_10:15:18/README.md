#To Test

Run the [controller][1]

[1]:/run/src/controller.py


#Database

There is already a database attached called [master.db][db]. It 
contains sample username and passwords which I submitted.
If you would like to delete that [database][db] and create a new one
do so by first deleting the "master.db" file and then runnning
the [scehma.py][sch]

[sch]:/run/src/schema.py 
[db]:/master.db
